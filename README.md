# üó£Ô∏è Detecting Parkinson‚Äôs Disease from Short Speech Recordings

Early vocal changes‚Äîreduced loudness, monotonous pitch, imprecise vowels‚Äîare reliable biomarkers of Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD).  
This repo shows how to **detect PD from a few-second voice sample** using three modern [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/) recipes:

* **X-vector TDNN**: The implementation of this model is based on the speechbrain's tutorial: [Speech Classification From Scratch](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tasks/speech-classification-from-scratch.html).  
* **ECAPA-TDNN**: The implementation of this model is based on the speechbrain's recipe: [Training ECAPA-TDNN embeddings for language identification (LID)](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/recipes/CommonLanguage/lang_id/hparams/train_ecapa_tdnn.yaml).
* **wav2vec 2.0 (fine-tuned)**: The implementation of this model is based on the speechbrain's recipe: [Emotion recognition from speech using wav2vec2](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/recipes/IEMOCAP/emotion_recognition/hparams/train_with_wav2vec2.yaml).

## Why this matters
* **Non-invasive screening** ‚Äì speech can be collected with any phone or tele-health platform  
* **Earlier diagnosis** ‚Äì dysarthric cues emerge before overt motor symptoms  
* **Multilingual challenge** ‚Äì practical systems must generalise beyond the training language

## Project Overview

1. **Datasets**  
   | Corpus | Lang | Utterances | Speakers (PD / HC) | Task |  
   |--------|------|------------|--------------------|------|  
   | [Italian (Dimauro 2017)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/birgermoell/Italian_Parkinsons_Voice_and_Speech) |  IT | 831 | 65 (28 / 37) | Sentences + vowels |  
   | Italian ‚Äì vowels only  |  IT | 495 | 50 (28 / 22) | Sustained vowels |  
   | [Czech vowel /a/](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Voice_Samples_for_Patients_with_Parkinson_s_Disease_and_Healthy_Controls/23849127)        |  CZ | 81  | 81 (40 / 41) | Sustained /a/ (cross-language) |

2. **Pipeline** (all inside one notebook)  
   * download & unpack ‚Üí speaker-independent **70 / 15 / 15** splits  
   * FBank or raw waveform ‚Üí SpeechBrain model ‚Üí training + plots  
   * evaluate **within-language** and **cross-language**

3. **Headline results**  

   | Test set | X-vector | ECAPA | wav2vec2 |
   |----------|----------|-------|----------|
   | Italian full | **1.5‚Äì7 %** | 7‚Äì11 % | **1‚Äì3 %** |
   | Italian vowels | 9‚Äì12 % | 12‚Äì18 % | **4‚Äì6 %** |
   | Czech vowels | 46 % (trained) | ‚Äî | 45‚Äì60 % (IT-trained)<br>**15 %** (fine-tuned) |

   *Take-away:* great accuracy in-language, big drop cross-language ‚Üí need multilingual/augmented data.
